# CAPTCHA-Solver

TO RUN TRAIN_KNN, MAKE SURE extracted_letter_images folder is in same directory.\
\
USE PYTHON IN TERMINAL TO TRAIN MODEL. MODEL WILL BE SAVED UNDER knn_model.pkl\
\
TESTING CAPTCHA FOLDER CONTAINED UNSEPEARATED CAPTCHA IMAGES\
\
TESTING_EXTRACTED CONTAINS EXTRACTED CHARACTERS AND USED FOR PREDICTIONS\
\
predict_knn.py DEPENDS ON TESTING_EXTRACTED FOLDER. IT USES THESE IMAGES FOR PREDICTIONS AND TESTING ACCURACY.}

**Due to size restrictions, data set has been truncated to a smaller subset of 1,000 images per directory. This does not impact accuracy as models are already trained. **
